== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= Where can I find support for this plugin? =

[WordPress Support Forum](http://www.wordpress.org/support/plugin/moneypress-cafepress-edition)

= What are the terms of the license? =

The license is based on GPL.  You get the code, feel free to modify it as you
wish.  I prefer that customers buy a premium add-on because they like what I do and
want to support my efforts to bring useful software to market.

= What percentage of sales do I keep? =

None.  Everything you earn through this plugin is yours, I don't siphon off
any of your sales or earn anything unless you purchase a premium add-on.

= How can I translate the plugin into my language? =

The plugin uses the standard WordPress language file system.

* Find on internet the free program POEDIT, and learn how it works.
* Use the .pot file located in the languages directory of this plugin to create or update the .po files.
* Place these file in the languages subdirectory.
* If everything is ok, email the files to me and I will add them to the next release.
* For more information on POT files, domains, gettext and i18n have a look at the I18n for WordPress developers Codex page and more specifically at the section about themes and plugins.

= How do I get my CafePress API Key? =

NOTE: CafePress has shut down the API program for new subscriptions.   They MAY re-activate it but they have not given an ETA on doing so.

Sign up at <a href="http://developer.cafepress.com/">Developer.cafepress.com</a> 
and fill out the Register My Application form.  It takes less than 5 minutes and 
is easier than setting up your original CafePress store.
